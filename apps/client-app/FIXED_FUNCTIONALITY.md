# Fixed Missing Functionality

## Issues Resolved

Previously, several calculated variables and functions were not being displayed in the UI, causing ESLint warnings and missing functionality. Here's what I fixed:

### ‚úÖ **Dashboard Missing Sections Added**

#### 1. **Upcoming Workouts Section**
**Previously**: `upcomingWorkouts` was calculated but never displayed
**Now**: Shows next 2 scheduled workouts with:
- üìÖ Workout name and full date/time
- üìç Location and duration  
- üè∑Ô∏è Workout type badge
- Only displays if there are upcoming workouts

#### 2. **Pending Tasks Section** 
**Previously**: `pendingTasks` was calculated but never displayed
**Now**: Shows up to 3 pending home tasks with:
- üìù Task title and description
- ‚è∞ Due date highlighting
- üè∑Ô∏è Task type (exercise, nutrition, reading, recovery)
- Shows count if more than 3 tasks exist

#### 3. **Mock Home Tasks Added**
**Previously**: Empty home tasks array
**Now**: 4 sample tasks including:
- "–í—ã–ø–æ–ª–Ω–∏—Ç—å –∫–∞—Ä–¥–∏–æ —Ç—Ä–µ–Ω–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∫—É" (exercise, due in 2 days)
- "–ü—Ä–æ—á–∏—Ç–∞—Ç—å —Å—Ç–∞—Ç—å—é –æ –ø–∏—Ç–∞–Ω–∏–∏" (reading, due in 3 days) 
- "–†–∞—Å—Ç—è–∂–∫–∞ –ø–æ—Å–ª–µ —Ç—Ä–µ–Ω–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∫–∏" (recovery, due tomorrow)
- "–ü–ª–∞–Ω–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏–µ –ø–∏—Ç–∞–Ω–∏—è" (nutrition, due in 5 days)

### ‚úÖ **Code Cleanup**

#### 1. **Removed Unused Variables**
- ‚ùå `setCurrentPage` in Dashboard.tsx
- ‚ùå `mockNotifications` array
- ‚ùå `suggestions` in AIAssistantWidget.tsx

#### 2. **Removed Unused Imports**
- ‚ùå `ChatBubbleLeftRightIcon` in AIAssistantWidget.tsx
- ‚ùå `ArrowRightIcon` in AIAssistantWidget.tsx
- ‚ùå `Notification` type in Dashboard.tsx

#### 3. **Fixed Dependencies**
- ‚úÖ Added missing `question.type` to useEffect dependency array in Questionnaire.tsx

## New Dashboard Layout

The dashboard now shows these sections in order:

1. **Profile Completion Banner** (if profile < 80% complete)
2. **Subscription Alert** (if expiring soon)
3. **Today's Workout** (if there's one scheduled today)
4. **My Coach Widget** (trainer information)
5. **AI Assistant Widget** (AI chat access)
6. **Upcoming Workouts** ‚≠ê NEW! (next 2 scheduled workouts)
7. **Pending Tasks** ‚≠ê NEW! (up to 3 home assignments)
8. **Calendar Widget** (full month view with workout dots)
9. **Quick Stats** (completed workouts, tasks, progress)

## Visual Improvements

### Upcoming Workouts
- üîµ Blue type badges for workout categories
- üìÖ Full Russian date format (e.g., "–ø–æ–Ω–µ–¥–µ–ª—å–Ω–∏–∫, –¥–µ–∫ 16")
- ‚è∞ Time display (e.g., "–≤ 10:00")
- üìç Location and duration info

### Pending Tasks  
- üü† Orange theme for urgency
- üìÖ Due date prominently displayed
- üè∑Ô∏è Color-coded type badges
- "–ï—â–µ N –∑–∞–¥–∞–Ω–∏–π..." if more tasks exist

## Expected User Experience

When users open the dashboard now, they'll see:

1. **Immediate action items**: Today's workout (if any) at the top
2. **Planning ahead**: Next 2 upcoming workouts clearly displayed
3. **Task management**: Home assignments with due dates
4. **Progress tracking**: Calendar with visual workout history
5. **Quick stats**: Completed workouts and tasks count

All previously unused data is now actively displayed, making the dashboard much more informative and actionable! üéØ
